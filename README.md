### Who am I?

I'm a Python developer trying to learn more about programming in general, I hope you can join me on my journey ðŸ˜„

```markdown
**What experience do you have?**

3 Years Ago - Well I've started out my journey by editing videos, I started with Adobe Premiere Pro, after a year I became a Freelancer for editing
2 Years Ago - I got into Python, but my experience with it this year wasn't broad, I was learning about programming in general rather then a specific language
1 Year Ago - My github is born! My true programming career started from here, I was learning Python, expanding to JS, Ruby and much more!

Now ! - I have been perfecting my Python Skills, learning more of JS and started offering my services! I am now currently a bug hunter for a community consisting of well over 60,000 people.

```

**Previous Job Experiences**
In the period of 2017-2018, I was a video editor Freelancing jobs for that duration of time
Mid 2018-2019 - I picked up programming, I didn't offer my services yet because I wanted to improve the quality of my code and work!
Late 2019-2021 - Fluent in Python, Moderate in building websites, learning the game engine Unity, during this time I took jobs as a leading Administrator for a group revolving around specific games in 2019, Left the team a couple months later to learn more by doing more!
Now fast forward to early 2020, I went on to work with a server with a peak of 110,000 thousand members, The server was very diverse but mainly focused with chatting / gaming, I quickly went up the ranks and then I went on to be a leading developer, moving to a moderator of the community, this was a position that required a lot of opportunity, providing me to expand my skills in the Help and Feedback space, After being this rank for a couple months I moved to an Administrator, now I was in charge of putting fixes to problems like unexpected site behaviour, managing staff members and rules but after the community has been dying down, it reached to a low enough state that now there was 600 members in total after the owner had unexpectedly left.
